✈️ SkyLift Airlines – Loyalty Campaign Performance Analysis
Project Elevate | Diagnostic Analytics Case Study
📌 Project Overview

SkyLift Airlines launched Project Elevate, a targeted loyalty campaign aimed at strengthening customer enrollment and engagement ahead of the critical summer travel season.

This project evaluates whether the campaign:

Altered loyalty enrollment patterns

Attracted more engaged, high-intent customers

Drove meaningful summer booking impact

Generated incremental demand rather than shifting existing bookings

The analysis is presented through a Power BI diagnostic dashboard, supported by behavioral and engagement metrics.

🎯 Objectives

The key business questions addressed in this analysis are:

Did the campaign change loyalty enrollment behavior?

Do campaign-acquired members behave differently early on?

Did the campaign influence summer booking performance?

Was demand incremental or simply shifted in time?

Did the campaign attract the “right” customers?

📊 Data & Methodology
Data Sources

Only datasets provided by the organizers were used:

Customer Loyalty Data – enrollment status, cancellations, campaign participation

Customer Flight Activity – flights per month, distance traveled, loyalty redemptions

Calendar Table – time alignment and seasonality analysis

📎 No external data sources were used.

Analytical Approach

Diagnostic (descriptive + comparative) analysis

Campaign vs non-campaign member comparisons

Behavioral proxies for engagement and value

Trend analysis across pre-campaign, campaign, and post-campaign periods

All insights were generated using Power BI.

🔍 Key Findings
1️⃣ Loyalty Enrollment Impact

Loyalty enrollments increased during the campaign period

Cancellation levels remained stable, preventing artificial inflation

Net enrollment growth was positive but controlled

Conclusion:
The campaign influenced enrollment timing while maintaining program stability.

2️⃣ Early Engagement Behavior

Campaign members showed higher average flights per active month

Early loyalty redemptions occurred sooner among campaign members

Despite smaller cohort size, engagement quality was higher

Conclusion:
Campaign-acquired members exhibit stronger early-stage engagement.

3️⃣ Summer Booking Performance

Campaign participants contributed a measurable share of summer bookings

Higher average distance per flight suggests longer or higher-value routes

Continued loyalty redemption during peak season indicates sustained engagement

Conclusion:
The campaign successfully aligned with SkyLift’s most critical revenue window.

4️⃣ Incremental Demand vs Shifted Bookings

Booking volumes increased during the campaign without a sharp post-campaign drop

Post-campaign demand normalized rather than collapsing

No strong evidence of demand being pulled forward

Conclusion:
Project Elevate generated incremental or accelerated demand, not just shifted bookings.

5️⃣ Strategic Customer Quality Assessment

Campaign members showed higher engagement intensity

Behavior suggests genuine travel intent, not bargain-driven sign-ups

Campaign still represents a smaller share of total bookings

Conclusion:
The campaign successfully attracted high-quality customers, with room to scale reach.

📄 Compliance Statement

This project strictly uses organizer-provided datasets.
All analysis outputs are reproducible using the supplied data and Power BI.

💼 Business Impact

The findings from Project Elevate provide actionable insights into how targeted loyalty campaigns can drive high-quality customer engagement rather than short-term volume spikes.

📈 Revenue Relevance

Campaign-acquired members demonstrated higher engagement intensity, flying more frequently per active month.

Higher average distance per flight during the summer season suggests preference for longer or higher-value routes.

Continued loyalty redemption during peak season indicates sustained usage, not one-time promotional behavior.

Impact:
The campaign successfully aligned loyalty enrollment with revenue-relevant travel behavior, improving the quality of demand during SkyLift’s most critical revenue window.

🎯 Customer Quality Over Quantity

Net enrollments grew steadily without a rise in cancellations, protecting loyalty program health.

Campaign members were not purely incentive-driven; behavioral signals indicate genuine travel intent.

Early engagement patterns suggest higher long-term value potential compared to historical cohorts.

Impact:
Instead of inflating the loyalty base with low-intent users, the campaign attracted travel-ready, high-intent customers, improving the long-term value of the loyalty program.

🔄 Demand Generation Efficiency

Booking volumes increased during the campaign period without a sharp post-campaign decline.

No strong evidence of bookings being pulled forward from future periods.

Impact:
This indicates incremental or accelerated demand, meaning the campaign added real value rather than redistributing existing bookings.

🚀 Strategic Takeaways for Future Campaigns

Scale similar campaigns toward segments showing early engagement and longer-route preferences.

Optimize post-enrollment nudges to convert high-quality sign-ups into higher booking volumes.

Use engagement-focused KPIs (not just enrollment counts) to evaluate campaign success.
