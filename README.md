# ✈️ SkyLift Airlines – Loyalty Campaign Performance Analysis  
### Project Elevate | Diagnostic Analytics Case Study

## 📌 Overview
SkyLift Airlines launched **Project Elevate**, a targeted loyalty campaign designed to strengthen customer enrollment and engagement ahead of the high-stakes **summer travel season**.  

This project evaluates whether the campaign meaningfully influenced:
- Loyalty enrollment behavior  
- Early customer engagement  
- Summer booking performance  
- Incremental demand generation  
- Customer quality and revenue relevance  

The analysis is delivered through a **Power BI diagnostic dashboard**, supported by behavioral and engagement metrics.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
This analysis addresses five core business questions:

1. Did the campaign alter loyalty enrollment patterns?  
2. Do campaign-acquired members behave differently early on?  
3. Did the campaign drive summer booking impact?  
4. Was demand incremental or simply shifted in time?  
5. Did the campaign attract the “right” customers?

## 📊 Data Used
Only organizer-provided datasets were used in this analysis:
- **Customer Loyalty Data** – enrollment status, cancellations, campaign participation  
- **Customer Flight Activity** – flights per month, distance traveled, loyalty redemptions  
- **Calendar Table** – time alignment for trends and seasonality  

📎 No external data sources were used.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Diagnostic (descriptive and comparative) analysis  
- Campaign vs non-campaign cohort comparisons  
- Engagement and value proxies (flight frequency, distance, redemptions)  
- Pre-, during-, and post-campaign trend analysis  

All insights were developed using **Power BI**.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Loyalty Enrollment Impact
- Loyalty enrollments increased during the campaign period.
- Cancellation levels remained relatively stable.
- Net enrollment growth was positive but controlled.

**Conclusion:**  
The campaign influenced enrollment timing while maintaining loyalty program stability.

---

### 2️⃣ Early Engagement Behavior
- Campaign-acquired members showed higher average flights per active month.
- Loyalty redemption activity occurred earlier among campaign members.
- Although cohort size was smaller, engagement quality was higher.

**Conclusion:**  
Campaign members exhibited stronger early-stage engagement than historical members.

---

### 3️⃣ Summer Booking Performance
- Campaign participants contributed a measurable share of summer bookings.
- Higher average distance per flight suggests preference for longer or higher-value routes.
- Loyalty redemption during summer indicates sustained engagement.

**Conclusion:**  
The campaign aligned effectively with SkyLift’s most critical revenue window.

---

### 4️⃣ Incremental Demand vs Shifted Bookings
- Booking volumes increased during the campaign without a sharp post-campaign decline.
- Post-campaign demand normalized rather than collapsing.
- No strong evidence of demand being pulled forward.

**Conclusion:**  
Project Elevate generated incremental or accelerated demand rather than shifted bookings.

---

### 5️⃣ Strategic Customer Quality Assessment
- Higher engagement intensity and longer routes indicate revenue-relevant travelers.
- Campaign members were not purely incentive-driven.
- Campaign contribution to total bookings remains scalable.

**Conclusion:**  
The campaign successfully attracted high-quality customers, with room to expand reach.

---

## 📈 Key KPIs
- Campaign Enrollment Rate  
- Average Flights per Campaign Member  
- Campaign Share of Summer Bookings  
- Average Distance per Flight (Summer)  
- Loyalty Redemption Activity  

These KPIs reinforce the diagnostic insights shown in the dashboard.

---

## 💼 Business Impact

The findings from **Project Elevate** demonstrate how targeted loyalty campaigns can drive high-quality engagement rather than short-term enrollment spikes.

### 📈 Revenue Relevance
- Campaign-acquired members flew more frequently per active month.
- Higher average distance per flight during summer suggests higher-value travel.
- Sustained loyalty redemptions indicate continued usage beyond enrollment.

**Impact:**  
The campaign aligned loyalty enrollment with revenue-generating travel behavior during peak season.

---

### 🎯 Customer Quality Over Quantity
- Enrollment growth occurred without increasing cancellation risk.
- Behavioral signals reflect genuine travel intent, not incentive-driven sign-ups.
- Early engagement patterns suggest stronger long-term value potential.

**Impact:**  
The campaign attracted travel-ready, high-intent customers instead of low-value sign-ups.

---

### 🔄 Demand Generation Efficiency
- Booking volume increased during the campaign without post-campaign drop-off.
- No evidence of demand being shifted from future periods.

**Impact:**  
Project Elevate generated incremental demand rather than redistributing existing bookings.
